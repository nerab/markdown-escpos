# Lists

They are pretty useful.

* This is the first line of an unordered list
* It has multiple lines
* This one has three

Another list goes like this:

- First line of the second list
- This one uses alternative marks. These are fine, too.

Finally, we have a nested list:

* What about nesting?

    - first item of nested list
    - two
    - three
    - newlines do not matter
* Last line of top-level list

Final words come at the end.
